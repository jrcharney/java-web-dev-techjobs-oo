# Java Web Development - TechJobs OO

Well, here's a rare instance. A README.md file in a LaunchCode project.

You're in for a treat this time!

If you have the PlantUML Integration plugin on IntelliJ IDEA, you'll be able to see the UML Class Diagram I made for this.

Generally, you should put your UML files and any images made from them into an `assets` directory.

The modified diagram is in [assets](assets/TechJobsOO2.png).

Programming the OOP was the easy part, but testing was a little more challenging.

As much as you should install JUnit 5, you are better off using JUnit 4 for Unit Testing on this assignment.

Also, put your tests in to a `test` directory in the `src` directory.

For some guidance as to how to install a testing library, [consult this page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-testing-libraries.html).
